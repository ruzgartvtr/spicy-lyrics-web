/**
 * A shared circuit breaker for every request the extension makes.

 * All traffic funnels through `Query()`, so one breaker covers lyrics, session
 * ops and the version check. Its job is to make sure that when the API (or
 * Cloudflare in front of it) starts refusing us, the client gets *quieter*
 * rather than louder — a retry storm from the userbase is what turns a blocked
 * DDoS into an outage.
 *
 * Two things are deliberately true here:
 *
 * - Only **transport-level** signals are consulted: `res.status` and `fetch`
 *   rejections. The per-query `httpStatus` inside the response envelope is
 *   application-level and must never reach this file — the lyrics queue signals
 *   with an envelope 503 on an HTTP 200, and tripping on that would break it.
 * - State is **persisted**. Users restart Spotify precisely when lyrics look
 *   broken, so an in-memory-only breaker would be cleared by the very people
 *   experiencing the outage.
